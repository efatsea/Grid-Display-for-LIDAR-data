==================
Animation examples
==================


Animation videos are saved to the Sphinx static directory in
``doc/source/videos``; this gets copied to ``doc/build/html/_static``. Since
example animations get built to ``doc/build/html/auto_examples/animation``, the
video tags need to have source paths that start with ``../../_static/``.
